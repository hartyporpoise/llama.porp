"""
Persistent WebSocket channel between peers.

After the peering handshake completes, the initiating side opens a
WebSocket connection to the accepting peer's /ws endpoint. All
subsequent peer-to-peer communication (workload submission, status callbacks,
proxy tunnelling) flows over this single persistent connection instead of
making new outbound HTTPS requests for each call.

This sidesteps the nginx client-cert-forwarding problem entirely: the WS
upgrade is a plain HTTPS request (nginx handles it fine), and once the
connection is established both sides authenticate via the CA cert check on
the first frame. No client cert needs to reach the Flask app.

Message framing (JSON):

  Request  {"id": "<uuid4-hex>", "type": "<method>", "payload": {...}}
  Reply    {"id": "<same>",       "type": "reply",    "ok": true|false,
            "payload": {...},     "error": "<str>"}    # error only when ok=false
  Push     {"type": "<event>",   "payload": {...}}     # no id — fire-and-forget

Types:
  remoteapp/receive       submit a RemoteApp to the peer for execution
  remoteapp/status        status update from executor back to submitter
  remoteapp/delete        delete a running RemoteApp
  remoteapp/scale         scale a RemoteApp
  remoteapp/detail        fetch k8s detail for a RemoteApp
  remoteapp/spec-update   push a new spec to the executor
  proxy/request           HTTP proxy request (payload includes base64 body)
  proxy/response          HTTP proxy response
  peer/disconnect         graceful disconnect notification
  ping                    keepalive
